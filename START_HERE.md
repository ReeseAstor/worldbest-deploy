## 🎯 Key Highlights

### Current State Analysis

**✅ What's Working:**
- Next.js 14 with TypeScript configured
- Authentication system (context-based)
- WebSocket provider infrastructure
- UI component library (Radix UI)
- Basic routing and navigation
- Supabase database connected

**⚠️ What Needs Work:**
- State management (Zustand configured but no stores)
- Custom hooks (directory doesn't exist)
- API clients (only auth module exists)
- Testing infrastructure (zero tests)
- Error handling (incomplete)
- Collaboration features (not implemented)
- AI integration (UI only)
- Billing (no Stripe integration)

**🔴 Critical Issues:**
1. Inconsistent token storage (localStorage vs cookies)
2. Duplicate API client instances
3. Fragile WebSocket authentication
4. No production monitoring
5. No test coverage
